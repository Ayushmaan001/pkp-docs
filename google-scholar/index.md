# Google Scholar Guide

- [English](en/)
- [PortuguÃªs](pt/)

This guide provides guidance around the indexing of Open Journal Systems (OJS) in Google Scholar. It is written largely for an audience of journal managers as well as systems administrators - those who are responsible for the installation, upgrading and general maintenance of the system. We have tried to suggest the sections which are most applicable to these two audiences.

This guide focuses on Google Scholar indexing of OJS sites. Some of this information is applicable to OMP and OPS sites, but Google Scholar interaction with these sites has not been researched.
